      <p>Williams was included in the Manchester United travelling squad for the UEFA Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain in March 2019, but was not named in the match squad. He made his first-team debut on 25 September as a substitute in an EFL Cup match against Rochdale. He made his first start on 3 October in the UEFA Europa League match against AZ Alkmaar. Williams signed a new long-term contract on 17 October, keeping him at the club until June 2022. He made his Premier League debut on 20 October against Liverpool at Old Trafford as a late substitute. With Ashley Young suspended and Luke Shaw injured, Williams was handed his first league start on 10 November against Brighton & Hove Albion, playing 90 minutes before being substituted for Marcos Rojo in injury time; he was voted Man of the Match by his club's fans.</p>
